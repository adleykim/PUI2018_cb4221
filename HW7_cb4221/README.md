I worked on my own for this homework. Our assigment was to load various data
from the Census to examine broadband connectivity in the five boroughs at the
PUMA level, using geopandas. We also looked at LinkNYC locations (initiative
to bring internet connectivity 'everywhere') around the City to see how the
locations of these service stations matched up with connectivity across the City (i.e. if 
they were adequately filling a need within the City.)
