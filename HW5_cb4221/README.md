Homework 5

1. Examine a peer's research plan and provide feedback on hypothesis framework and type of test to use.

2. Pick two test types (I picked chi square and multiple regression) along with logistic regression and find papers that use these test methods. See table below for description of type and number of variables used and plots summarizing each paper's results.

3. Reproducing the analysis of the Hard to Employ program in New York: looking at 'ever employed in a CEO transitional job' and
'convicted of a felony'. Z and Chi-square tests were conducted against the null hypothesis, which was that the program had no effect
on different outcomes we were examining.

4. Conduct Pearson's, Spearman's, and a KS test on two samples of Citibike data for trip duration of bikes during the day and night. I looked at the month of February and June 2015.
