For this homework, I worked mostly by myself, but received help from Martha Norrick and Nathan Caplan
to generate some of the plots.

For the first assignment, I generated several different distributions to demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem. In the final graph, I plotted all distributions together.

For the second assignment, I pulled CitiBike data and looked at the breakdown of ridership between people born in 1980 and 1981. I hypothesized that people born in 1981 used CitiBike more than those born in 1980.

For the third assignment, we investigated the possible effects of a new bus route in New York. Our null hypothesis was that the new route would have no effect or a negative effect on commute times. To test this, we performed a z-test with an alpha of .05.
