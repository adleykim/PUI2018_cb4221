Scope of the homework:

1.  Create a test file and push it to our GitHub repository. Through the terminal,
remove all history of the file in our repository and on our machine.

2.  Pull data from NYC Open Data, read data using pandas, remove all but two numerical columns from dataset and plot the two variables. 

3. Using our MTA API key, read bus data from a json file, produce three outputs showing which bus line we're looking at, how many buses are active, and their current location.
